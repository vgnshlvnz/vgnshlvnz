- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on jails in FreeBSD RELEASE. You can visit my **work** @ https://vgnshlv.nz
- This repo will contain rc vars, PF Firewall rules, & jail init scripts.

There are 3 files in this repository, first is the rc vars in `rc.conf` which you need to place in `/etc/rc.conf`. The 2nd file is PF Firewall aka `pf.conf` which you have to place in `/etc/pf.conf`. The last file is the jail init files in which you have to init the jails using `bsdinstall`. The file is `jail.conf` which you have to place it in `/etc/jail.conf`

To cut it short and easy, jails is what Linux does with Docker, Podman and etc. My entire configuration is not that safe as I do not have a skeleton jail linking to actual jails.
